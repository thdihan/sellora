# Product Module Access Control Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the access control implementation for the Product Module in the Sellora application. The implementation restricts access to product-related functionality to users with specific roles.

## Implemented Access Control

### Restricted Controllers
The following controllers now have role-based access control:

1. **ProductController** (`app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php`)
   - Manages product CRUD operations
   - Access restricted to: `Author` and `Admin` roles

2. **ProductBrandController** (`app/Http/Controllers/ProductBrandController.php`)
   - Manages product brand operations
   - Access restricted to: `Author` and `Admin` roles

3. **ProductCategoryController** (`app/Http/Controllers/ProductCategoryController.php`)
   - Manages product category operations
   - Access restricted to: `Author` and `Admin` roles

4. **WarehouseController** (`app/Http/Controllers/WarehouseController.php`)
   - Manages warehouse operations
   - Access restricted to: `Author` and `Admin` roles

### Implementation Details

#### Middleware Implementation
Each controller includes a constructor with middleware that:
- Checks if the authenticated user has either `Author` or `Admin` role
- Returns a 403 Unauthorized response for users with other roles
- Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page

```php
public function __construct()
{
    $this->middleware(function ($request, $next) {
        if (!Auth::check()) {
            return redirect()->route('login');
        }
        
        $userRole = Auth::user()->role->name;
        if (!in_array($userRole, ['Author', 'Admin'])) {
            if ($request->ajax()) {
                return response()->json(
                    ['error' => 'Unauthorized access'],
                    403
                );
            }
            abort(403, 'Unauthorized access');
        }
        
        return $next($request);
    });
}
```

#### UI Access Control
The sidebar navigation has been updated to hide product-related menu items from unauthorized users:

- Product menu items are only visible to users with `Author` or `Admin` roles
- Implemented using Blade directive: `@if(auth()->check() && in_array(auth()->user()->role->name, ['Author', 'Admin']))`

### Available Roles
The system currently has the following roles:
- Author (has access to product module)
- Admin (has access to product module)
- Chairman, Director, ED, GM, DGM, AGM, NSM, ZSM, RSM, ASM, MPO, MR, Trainee (no access to product module)

### Testing Results
Access control has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Author role: Can access all product controllers
- ✅ Admin role: Can access all product controllers
- ✅ Other roles (e.g., Trainee): Access denied with proper error handling
- ✅ Unauthenticated users: Redirected to login page
- ✅ UI elements properly hidden for unauthorized users

### Security Considerations
- All product-related routes are protected at the controller level
- Both AJAX and regular HTTP requests are handled appropriately
- Proper error responses (403 Unauthorized) are returned for denied access
- UI elements are hidden to prevent unauthorized access attempts

### Maintenance Notes
- To add new roles with product access, update the role array in each controller's middleware
- When adding new product-related controllers, ensure similar access control is implemented
- UI access control should be updated when adding new product-related menu items
